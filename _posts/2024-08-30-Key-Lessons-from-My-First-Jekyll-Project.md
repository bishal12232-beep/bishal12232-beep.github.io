I recently used Jekyll for my first time and learned a lot:

- Static Sites: Jekyll generates fast, static HTML.
- Layouts & Includes: Modular design for easy site management.
- Markdown: Simplifies content creation.
- Config File: _config.yml for site settings.
- Front Matter: Metadata in pages and posts.
- GitHub Pages: Easy deployment integration.
- Troubleshooting: Improved my problem-solving skills.
- Themes: Customizable without starting from scratch.
- Performance: Static sites are fast, with room for optimization.
- Learning: Jekyll has a rich ecosystem to explore.
Overall, Jekyll makes building and managing static sites straightforward and efficient.
