# Working on CSS for My Jekyll Site

To customize the appearance of my Jekyll site, I needed to work on its CSS. This guide covers the steps I took to inspect, analyze, and modify CSS for a more refined look. 

## Intercepting the Page

* Right-click on the element you want to inspect to open the browser's developer tools.
