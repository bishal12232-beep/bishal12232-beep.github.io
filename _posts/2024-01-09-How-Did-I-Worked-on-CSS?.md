# Working on CSS for My Jekyll Site

To customize the appearance of my Jekyll site, I needed to work on its CSS. This guide covers the steps I took to inspect, analyze, and modify CSS for a more refined look. 

## Intercepting the Page

* Right-click on the element you want to inspect to open the browser's developer tools.
* Use the "Inspect" option to view the HTML and CSS associated with the element.

## Analyzing the CSS Code

* Navigate to the "Elements" tab in the developer tools to view the HTML structure and the applied CSS.
* Locate the CSS file responsible for the styles in the "Styles" panel.
* Review the CSS rules and properties affecting the element, such as color, font-size, and layout.

## Modifying the CSS Code

* Edit the CSS file used by your Jekyll site to adjust or add new rules as needed.
* Test the changes by refreshing the webpage and verifying the updates across different devices and screen sizes.

## Implementing the Final Code

* Update the main CSS file in your Jekyll project with the finalized code.
* Deploy the updated site to make the changes live.

## Conclusion

Working with CSS involves a few crucial steps from inspecting elements to applying and testing changes. By following these steps, you can effectively manage the styling of your Jekyll site and enhance its visual appeal.
